<h3> Examples of Car Dashboards </h3>
<img src="cardashboard1.jpg" style="height:400px;width:800px"alt=" example 1">

 <h4> Pros </h4>
  <ul>
     <li> The speedometer and Tachometer are clearly differentiated. speedometer is digitalised.</li>
     <li> The dashboard is clear and can be understood easily by the user.</li>
  </ul>
 <h4> Cons </h4>
   <ul>
      <li> The letters on top of the dashboard A represents ABS and N stands to show that automatic transmission is in neutral.<br> Most of the users cannot figure that out just by looking at it. </li>
      <li>Using letters to represent operation confuses the driver.</li>
   </ul>
<h4> Example Two </h4>
<img src="cardashboard2.jpg" style="height:400px;width:800px"alt=" example 2">

<h4> Pros </h4>
<ul>
<li> The design of dashboard is clear and understandable.</li>
<li> Digital display shows fuel indicator, odometer, speedometer, time and temperature.<br>This makes it easier for driver to read.</li>
<li> All the functions are uniformly placed.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Cons </h4>
<ul>
<li> On the digital display three bars indicating different functions is not clear.<br> User cannot understand their operation just by looking at it.</li>
<li> All three bars representing fuel indication, oil temperature can be represented more clearly.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Example Three</h4>
<img src="cardashboard3.jpg" style="height:400px;width:800px"alt=" example 3">

<h4> Pros </h4>
<ul>
<li> The speedometer, Tachometer, and fuel guage are clearly distiguished.</li>
<li> Overall placement of dashboard works well </li>
</ul>
<h4> Cons </h4>
<ul>
<li> Units of measurement is not clearly shown.</li>
<li> warning signals are not precise.</li>
<li> Too many buttons on the steering wheel. User might not know how to use them properly.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Example Four</h4>
<img src="cardashboard4.jpg" style="height:400px;width:800px"alt=" example 4">

<h4> Pros </h4>
<ul> 
<li> The design looks basic,clear and simple without any complications. </li>
</ul>
<h4> Cons </h4>
<ul>
<li> The numbering size should be increased. It does not provide proper view for the driver. </li>
<li> Placement of fuel indication and oil temperature is not easily noticable. one has to look for it inorder to find out. </li>
</ul>
<h4> Example Five</h4>
<img src="cardashboard5.jpg" style="height:400px;width:800px"alt=" example 5">

<h4> Cons </h4>
<ul>
<li> This is bad design for a car dashboard.</li>
<li> There are lot of buttons on the steering. The driver can press any button while driving unintentionally.<br> This leads to unnecessary complications. </li>
<li> The dashboard looks so complicated and nothing is clearly shown. One cannot even point out where the speedometer is.</li>
<li> This Car dashboard presents exactly how a car dashboard should not be. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Common Features of Car Dashboard </h2>
<ul>
<li> Car dashboard is control panel which is usually located directly ahead of driver. It displays the functioning and condition of the vehicle.</li>
<li> A car dashboard typically includes  the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, engine coolant temperature gauge,<br> and fuel gauge, turn indicators, gearshift position indicator, seat belt warning light, parking-brake warning light, and engine-malfunction lights.</li>
<li>The speedometer tells the driver the speed of vehicle in MPH or KPH.</li>
<li>Tachometer shows the driver how many rotations the engine is making per minute.</li>
<li>Odometer shows how many miles the car has traveled in its lifetime.</li>
<li>Fuel Gauge shows the amount of fuel present in the tank.</li>
<li>Gear Display shows which gear the car is currently in.</li>
<li>Turn Signal Indicators flash when turn signals are on;both will flash if we turn on our hazard lights.</li>
<li>Active System Lights alert us to parts of the vehicle that are activated, such as an open trunk or door.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Rare Features of Car Dashboard </h2>
<ul>
<li>Most of the drivers does not have complete knowledge of the car dashboard warning light.<br> One such warning light most users are unaware of is Gas tank locator arrow.<br> It helps the driver to locate which side of the car is fuel tank located by saving some time for the driver.</li>
<li>Another rarely used feature is every car has temperature sensor that indicates the exterior temperature. <br>In most cases, these sensors activate a road temperature warning as there is drop in temperature.<br> It is indicated using a snowflake on dashboard, letting the driver know that roads might be icy.</li>
<li>Cruise control is another feature which allows driver to lock the accelerator on a specific speed and take his or her foot off pedal. <br>It is designed to be on roadways without frequent stops and turns like highways.</li>
<li>Another feature is night vision. In some vehicles the dashboard screen goes into a night vision mode to show the road ahead of driver in greater detail at night.</li>
<li>Trip odometer is also least used function.</li>
</ul>
<h2> User interaction </h2>
<ul> 
<li>Accelerator to increase or decrease speed of car.</li>
<li>Turn signals.</li>
<li>Headlights.</li>
<li>Cruise controls.</li>
<li>The amount of fuel present is reflected in the fuel gauge.</li>
<li>Seat belt warning signal and other warning signals.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul> 
<li>Making the dashboard look complicated trying to make it user friendly.</li>
<li>User cannot understand all the symbols displayed on dashboard.</li>
<li>The car door open warning signal does not exactly tell which door is not properly closed.</li>
<li>Not clearly defining the difference between tachometer and speedometer.</li>
<li>Usage of the color on dashboard. It plays major role because it might not provide clear understanding, or it might be too distracting for the driver.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Changes made to Control Interface </h3>
<ul>
<li> The Speedometer and the Tachometer are clearly separated.This avoids any confusion for the user.</li>
<li> A digital display at the top is added. It includes Time, Temperature, speed, odometer, turn signals etc.</li>
<li> All the warning lights will be displayed on the top digital display.</li>
<li> Two bars are placed between speedometer and tachometer which displays the fuel indication and engine temperature. </li>
<li> In the bottom, there are interactive buttons which includes cruise control, turn signals, etc.</li>
<li> The whole point of the desgin is to make the car dashboard usage less complicated, simple and user friendly. </li>
<li> The (P R N D) gives the driver an idea about the motion of vehicle.</li>
</ul>
